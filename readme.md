# Mmlib4j-ml

The mmlib4j-ml is a Java Library for Machine Learning Prediction.

## Instaling

The library can be cloned from the github by the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/gobber/mmlib4j-ml
```

## Dependencies

The mmlib4j-ml has only two Java external dependencies:

```
com.github.fommil.netlib version: 2.1
com.google.code.gson version: 2.8.5
```

## Future improvements

Currently, the mmlib4j-ml does not support advanced cash.
However, we intend to implement it as soon as possible, because
for a large application the memory re-allocation can be an issue.
